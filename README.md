This repository contains code to reproduce results as given in the paper "Data-Adaptive and Automatic Stable Threshold Calibration for Stability Selection in Penalised Regression". 

An example of the simulation study conducted is found in "Simulations.R". We also provide the Plasma Proteomics data used in Section 5.2 as "Proteomics.csv". The Riboflavin dataset in Section 5.3 can be accessed through the hdi package.
